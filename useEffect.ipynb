    "## Benefits of `useEffect`\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Managing Side Effects:**\n",
    "    - `useEffect` is designed to handle side effects in functional components. Side effects can include data fetching, subscriptions, manual DOM manipulations, and more.\n",
    "    - It allows you to encapsulate side-effect-related code in a separate block, improving code organization and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Asynchronous Operations:**\n",
    "    - When dealing with asynchronous operations, such as data fetching or API calls, `useEffect` provides a clean way to handle these operations and update the component state accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Component Lifecycle Events:**\n",
    "    - In class components, lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` were used to manage different stages of the component lifecycle. `useEffect` allows functional components to achieve similar behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Dependency Management:**\n",
    "    - The dependency array in `useEffect` allows you to specify dependencies for the effect. When the values in the dependency array change, the effect is re-run. This helps in controlling when the effect should run and avoids unnecessary re-execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Preventing Memory Leaks:**\n",
    "    - `useEffect` helps in cleaning up resources and preventing memory leaks. You can return a cleanup function from the effect, and it will be executed when the component is unmounted or when the dependencies change.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Improving Performance:**\n",
    "    - By controlling when an effect runs and optimizing its dependencies, you can avoid unnecessary computations and improve the performance of your components.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Synchronizing with External Events:**\n",
    "    - `useEffect` is useful for synchronizing with external events, such as changes in the browser's location, the resizing of the window, or changes in the state of global stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **Code Organization:**\n",
    "    - Separating side-effect-related code from the render logic improves code organization and readability. It helps in maintaining a clean and understandable structure for your components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, `useEffect` is a powerful tool that addresses many challenges related to side effects and asynchronous operations in React functional components. It enables you to write cleaner and more maintainable code while providing control over the component's lifecycle.\n"

    "**In this example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We have a functional component `ExampleComponent` with a state variable `data` and an initial value passed as a prop (`initialData`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The `useEffect` hook is used to fetch data from an API when the component mounts and whenever the `data` state changes. The dependency array (`[data]`) specifies that the effect depends on the `data` state. If `data` changes, the effect will re-run.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inside the `useEffect` callback, we define a function `fetchData` that performs the asynchronous data fetching. If the data is successfully fetched, the `setData` function is called to update the component state.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The component renders the current value of `data` and a button that allows the user to update the data. When the button is clicked, the `setData` function is called, and since `data` is a dependency of the effect, the effect will run again, triggering the data-fetching logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to use the dependency array to control when the `useEffect` should run based on changes in specific state variables. It's a common pattern for handling side effects in React components.\n"
