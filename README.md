# React Native Notes

Welcome to my React Native Notes! This is a collection of Jupyter Notebook (`*.ipynb`) files where I've documented my learning journey with React Native. The notebooks are used purely for documentation purposes, containing code snippets, explanations, and examples focusing on various aspects of React Native development, such as understanding how to use `useEffect`, what the context API is, and much more.

## Overview

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a personal reference and a resource for others who are learning React Native. Each notebook is a compilation of notes, code examples, and explanations on different React Native topics. These documents are not interactive but are intended to provide clear and concise guidance on specific React Native features and concepts.

## Getting Started

To benefit from these notes, a basic understanding of React Native and its core principles is recommended. If you're new to React Native, you might find it helpful to start with [React Native's official documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started).

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of React Native
- Familiarity with JavaScript and ES6 syntax

### Viewing the Notebooks
